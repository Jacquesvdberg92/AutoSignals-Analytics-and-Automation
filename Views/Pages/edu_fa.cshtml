                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">Introduction</h6>
                <p>
                    Fundamental analysis (FA) in the crypto world focuses on evaluating a project's real-world value, utility, and potential for growth. Instead of relying on charts alone, this approach looks at what makes a coin or token valuable over time.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">1. What is Fundamental Analysis?</h6>
                <p>
                    Fundamental analysis helps traders and investors determine whether a cryptocurrency is under- or overvalued by examining various on-chain and off-chain factors. It’s more about the *why* behind the price than the *how*.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">2. Key Factors to Consider</h6>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Project Whitepaper</strong><br />
                        A well-written whitepaper outlines the project's goals, use case, technology, tokenomics, and roadmap. It’s the blueprint of any crypto project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Team & Advisors</strong><br />
                        A strong, transparent, and experienced team can be a sign of legitimacy and potential. Always research founders and their track records.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Utility & Use Case</strong><br />
                        Ask yourself: What problem is this project solving? Is there real demand for the token or technology?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Community & Developer Activity</strong><br />
                        A vibrant community and active GitHub or dev activity are green flags. They show real engagement and progress.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tokenomics</strong><br />
                        Look at total supply, inflation/deflation mechanics, vesting periods, and distribution. A project with poor tokenomics can struggle to hold value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Partnerships & Adoption</strong><br />
                        Has the project formed real-world partnerships? Is it gaining traction or being adopted in any industries?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">3. On-Chain Metrics</h6>
                <p>
                    On-chain data like transaction volume, wallet activity, and staking participation give insight into how actively a network is being used.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">4. Red Flags to Watch Out For</h6>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li>No working product or code after years of development</li>
                    <li>Over-promised partnerships with no proof</li>
                    <li>Poorly written or vague whitepapers</li>
                    <li>Centralized token ownership (whale control)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
                    📘 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use platforms like <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" target="_blank">CoinGecko</a>, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank">CoinMarketCap</a>, and <a href="https://www.tokeninsight.com/" target="_blank">TokenInsight</a> to check token data and project health.

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">Final Thoughts</h6>
                <p>
                    While price charts show what has happened, fundamental analysis helps you decide *what's worth investing in*. It’s a long-term approach focused on value and sustainability rather than hype. Combine it with technical analysis for a more complete view of the market.
