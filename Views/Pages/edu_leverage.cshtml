                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">Introduction</h6>
                <p>
                    Leverage and margin trading can amplify both gains and losses in the crypto market. These tools are powerful but risky, and understanding how they work is essential before using them in your trading strategy.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">1. What is Margin Trading?</h6>
                <p>
                    Margin trading allows you to borrow funds from an exchange to increase the size of your trade. You’re essentially using your existing balance as collateral to open larger positions than your account balance would otherwise allow.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">2. What is Leverage?</h6>
                <p>
                    Leverage is the ratio of borrowed funds to your own capital. For example, 10x leverage means you can trade with 10 times your actual investment. If you put in $100 and use 10x leverage, your position size is $1,000.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">3. Pros and Cons of Using Leverage</h6>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li><strong>✅ Pros:</strong> Magnify potential profits, enter larger positions with less capital, more efficient use of funds.</li>
                    <li><strong>⚠️ Cons:</strong> Increased risk of liquidation, higher emotional stress, small market movements can wipe out your position.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">4. Liquidation Risk</h6>
                <p>
                    If your trade moves against you, and your margin falls below a required threshold, your position may be *liquidated*. This means the exchange forcibly closes it, and you lose most or all of your margin. Always know your liquidation price before opening a leveraged trade.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">5. Best Practices for Margin Trading</h6>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Begin with low leverage (e.g., 2x) to understand the mechanics without excessive risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Stop-Losses:</strong> Set predefined exit points to protect against sudden market moves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Never Go All-In:</strong> Keep spare capital and only allocate a portion to leveraged trades.</li>
                    <li><strong>Watch Funding Rates:</strong> On perpetual contracts, long or short positions may pay periodic fees based on market imbalance.</li>
                </ul>

                    ⚠️ <strong>Important:</strong> Leverage can be a double-edged sword. Beginners should avoid high leverage and focus on learning first.

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">Final Thoughts</h6>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    Leverage and margin can offer exciting opportunities, but they also come with increased risk. Respect the power of these tools and always trade with discipline. The goal isn’t just to grow fast — it’s to grow consistently and sustainably.
