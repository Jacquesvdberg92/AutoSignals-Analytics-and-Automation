                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">What is Technical Analysis?</h6>
                <p>
                    Technical analysis (TA) is a method of evaluating cryptocurrencies by analyzing statistical trends from market activity, such as price movements and trading volume. Unlike fundamental analysis, TA focuses on patterns, indicators, and charts to make trading decisions.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">1. Candlestick Patterns</h6>
                <p>
                    Candlesticks show how prices move within a specific time frame and are key to reading charts. Each candlestick shows four data points: open, close, high, and low.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Green candle:</strong> Price closed higher than it opened.</li>
                    <li><strong>Red candle:</strong> Price closed lower than it opened.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">2. Support and Resistance</h6>
                <p>
                    These are key levels where price often reverses direction. Support acts as a "floor" where buying interest appears. Resistance acts as a "ceiling" where selling interest increases.
                </p>
                <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
                    📌 <strong>Tip:</strong> Support/resistance zones are rarely exact — they work more like areas or ranges than specific lines.
                </div>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">3. Trend Lines & Chart Patterns</h6>
                <p>
                    Trend lines help identify the direction of price movements — uptrend, downtrend, or sideways. Patterns like triangles, flags, and head & shoulders formations can signal potential price moves.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">4. Indicators & Oscillators</h6>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Moving Averages (MA):</strong> Smooth out price data to reveal trends over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>RSI (Relative Strength Index):</strong> Measures if a coin is overbought or oversold.</li>
                    <li><strong>MACD:</strong> Tracks momentum and possible trend reversals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bollinger Bands:</strong> Indicate price volatility and possible breakout zones.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">5. Volume Analysis</h6>
                <p>
                    Volume confirms the strength of price moves. High volume during an uptrend shows strong buying interest, while low volume may signal a weak or fake breakout.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">Practice & Patience</h6>
                <p>
                    No indicator guarantees success. TA is about increasing your probability of making good trades, not predicting the future. Use demo platforms like TradingView to practice chart reading without financial risk.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">Final Thoughts</h6>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    Technical analysis is a valuable tool for crypto traders, helping you time entries and exits more effectively. Combined with risk management and a clear strategy, TA can boost your confidence and performance in the market.
