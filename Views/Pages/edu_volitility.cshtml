                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">What is Volatility?</h6>
                <p>
                    Volatility refers to the rate at which the price of a crypto asset increases or decreases over a given time. In crypto, volatility is especially high due to the market's youth, low liquidity compared to traditional assets, and rapid shifts in investor sentiment.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">1. Why is Crypto So Volatile?</h6>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Low market cap:</strong> Compared to traditional markets, crypto is still small, making it more sensitive to large trades.</li>
                    <li><strong>Speculation:</strong> Prices are driven more by news, hype, and emotion than fundamentals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regulatory uncertainty:</strong> Shifts in government policies can spark rapid market reactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>24/7 trading:</strong> Crypto never sleeps, which means price moves can happen any time — day or night.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">2. Measuring Volatility</h6>
                <p>
                    Common tools to measure volatility include:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>ATR (Average True Range):</strong> Shows how much an asset typically moves over a period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bollinger Bands:</strong> Wider bands mean more volatility; tighter bands suggest consolidation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Historical Volatility:</strong> Analyzes past price fluctuations to gauge potential risk.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">3. Volatility and Risk Management</h6>
                <p>
                    High volatility offers more trading opportunities but also increases risk. Proper risk management techniques, such as using stop-loss orders and adjusting position sizes, are essential when trading volatile assets.
                </p>

                    💡 <strong>Remember:</strong> Volatility is a double-edged sword — it creates opportunity, but without a plan, it can also lead to losses.
                </div>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">4. Strategies for Dealing with Volatility</h6>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Trade smaller positions:</strong> Reduce position sizes when volatility spikes to manage risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid overtrading:</strong> Don't feel pressured to enter a trade just because the market is moving quickly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zoom out:</strong> Use higher timeframes to avoid getting caught in short-term noise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Set alerts:</strong> Use price alerts instead of staring at the screen to stay calm and reactive, not impulsive.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">Final Thoughts</h6>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    Understanding volatility is key to becoming a successful trader. Instead of fearing it, learn how to read it, manage it, and use it to your advantage. With patience and practice, volatility becomes less of a threat — and more of a tool.
