                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">Introduction</h6>
                <p>
                    Managing your crypto safely starts with understanding wallets and how to protect your assets. With the rise of hacks and scams, securing your funds is just as important as trading them. This guide walks you through wallet types and key security practices.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">1. Types of Crypto Wallets</h6>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Hot Wallets:</strong> Connected to the internet (e.g., mobile apps, browser extensions like MetaMask). Convenient but more vulnerable to hacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold Wallets:</strong> Offline storage (e.g., hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor, or even paper wallets). Ideal for long-term holdings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Custodial Wallets:</strong> Held by exchanges. Easy to use but you don’t control the private keys.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Custodial Wallets:</strong> You hold the keys — and the responsibility. Offers more control and privacy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">2. Public vs. Private Keys</h6>
                <p>
                    Every wallet has a public key (like your account number) and a private key (like your password). <strong>Never share your private key or seed phrase.</strong> If someone gains access to it, they can steal your funds.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">3. Best Practices for Security</h6>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Use hardware wallets:</strong> For storing significant funds, cold wallets are the most secure option.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enable 2FA:</strong> Always turn on two-factor authentication on exchanges and wallets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Beware of phishing:</strong> Double-check URLs and avoid clicking on suspicious links or pop-ups.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backup your recovery phrase:</strong> Store it offline and in multiple secure locations. Never take a screenshot of it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep software up to date:</strong> Wallet apps and firmware updates often include security patches.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
                    ⚠️ <strong>Reminder:</strong> If you don’t control your private keys, you don’t truly own your crypto.
                </div>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">4. Avoiding Common Scams</h6>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Fake apps:</strong> Only download wallets from official sites or verified app stores.</li>
                    <li><strong>Impersonators:</strong> Scammers may pretend to be support agents or influencers. Don’t trust unsolicited messages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pump-and-dump groups:</strong> Avoid “secret tips” or investment groups promising guaranteed returns.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">Final Thoughts</h6>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    Your crypto is only as safe as the precautions you take. By understanding the tools available and following solid security habits, you can protect your investments from unnecessary risk and stay in control of your digital assets.
