                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">Introduction</h6>
                <p>
                    Risk management is one of the most important skills any crypto trader can learn. While profits are exciting, protecting your capital ensures long-term survival and success in volatile markets. This guide introduces foundational risk control strategies every trader should practice.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">1. Never Risk More Than You Can Afford to Lose</h6>
                <p>
                    Crypto markets are highly volatile. Only invest funds that you are mentally and financially prepared to lose. This mindset helps reduce emotional stress and prevents reckless decisions.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">2. Use Stop-Loss Orders</h6>
                <p>
                    A stop-loss is a tool that automatically closes your position at a predetermined price to limit losses. For example, if you buy at $1,000 and set a stop-loss at $950, your trade will close automatically if the price drops—protecting you from bigger losses.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">3. Position Sizing</h6>
                <p>
                    Don’t bet your entire portfolio on a single trade. A good rule of thumb is to risk only 1–2% of your total capital per trade. This helps you survive a string of losses without blowing up your account.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">4. Diversification</h6>
                <p>
                    Spread your investments across multiple assets to reduce the risk of one coin tanking your entire portfolio. Diversification helps balance potential losses with gains in other areas.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">5. Emotional Control</h6>
                <p>
                    FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and panic selling are common mistakes. Sticking to a plan and avoiding emotional decisions is critical. Always trade with logic, not emotion.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">6. Set Risk/Reward Ratios</h6>
                <p>
                    A good trade setup has a favorable risk/reward ratio—typically 1:2 or better. This means you're aiming to make twice as much as you're willing to lose on any given trade.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">Final Thoughts</h6>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    Mastering risk management is what separates consistent traders from gamblers. By protecting your capital and trading with discipline, you give yourself the opportunity to grow over time—even through losses. Focus on survival first, profits second.
