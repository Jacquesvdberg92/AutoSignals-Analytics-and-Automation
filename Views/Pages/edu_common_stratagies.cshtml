                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">Introduction</h6>
                <p>
                    Successful trading often involves following a proven strategy rather than acting on emotion or hype. Below are some of the most common strategies used in the crypto world — whether you're a beginner or leveling up your skills.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">1. HODLing</h6>
                <p>
                    <strong>“Hold On for Dear Life”</strong> — HODLing is the simplest strategy: buy and hold a cryptocurrency for the long term, regardless of short-term volatility. This is ideal for those who believe in the long-term value of certain projects.

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">2. Day Trading</h6>
                <p>
                    Day traders open and close positions within the same day to take advantage of small price movements. It requires constant market monitoring, technical analysis, and quick decision-making.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">3. Swing Trading</h6>
                <p>
                    Swing traders look for medium-term opportunities over several days or weeks. They try to “swing” between lows and highs, capturing chunks of a trend rather than small fluctuations.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">4. Scalping</h6>
                <p>
                    Scalping involves making dozens or hundreds of trades in a day to profit from tiny price changes. It’s fast-paced, high-risk, and best left to experienced traders with lightning reflexes.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">5. Copy Trading / Signals</h6>
                <p>
                    Many beginners follow the trades of experienced traders or Telegram signal groups. While convenient, this requires due diligence — not all signals are reliable or transparent.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">6. Arbitrage</h6>
                <p>
                    Arbitrage takes advantage of price differences across exchanges. For example, if Bitcoin is $50 higher on one exchange than another, a trader might buy on the cheaper one and sell on the more expensive one.
                </p>

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">Key Tips Across All Strategies</h6>
                <ul class="mb-3">
                    <li>Always use stop-losses to manage risk.</li>
                    <li>Stick to one strategy while learning — don’t jump between them.</li>
                    <li>Backtest your strategy with historical data or use a demo account.</li>
                </ul>

                    <strong>⚠️ Trading is not one-size-fits-all:</strong> Pick a strategy that fits your time availability, risk tolerance, and personality.

                <h6 class="fw-medium mb-3 text-primary">Final Thoughts</h6>
                <p>
                    There are countless ways to trade crypto, but the most important part is finding a strategy that you can execute consistently. Keep learning, practice with small amounts, and evolve your approach as you gain experience.
